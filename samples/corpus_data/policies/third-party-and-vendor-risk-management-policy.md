# Third-Party & Vendor Risk Management Policy

## Purpose
Establish a consistent process for evaluating, onboarding, and monitoring third parties that provide services, data, or software impacting TAP environments.

## Vendor Lifecycle
1. **Request:** Business owner documents use case, data involved, and criticality.
2. **Due Diligence:** Security reviews SOC 2/ISO reports, penetration tests, questionnaires, and legal agreements. High-risk vendors require onsite/virtual assessment.
3. **Contracting:** Include security clauses (breach notification, data handling, subcontractor controls, right to audit).
4. **Onboarding:** Configure technical integrations with least privilege, monitoring, and logging.
5. **Monitoring:** Annual reassessment, continuous monitoring for breaches, and performance metrics.
6. **Termination:** Revoke access, ensure data deletion certification, and update asset inventory.

## Risk Scoring
- Criteria: data sensitivity, connectivity level, compliance impact, availability criticality.
- High-risk vendors require executive approval and compensating controls.

## Responsibilities
- **Vendor Owner:** Maintains relationship, ensures vendor meets obligations.
- **Security & Privacy:** Lead assessments, track remediation plans, and maintain vendor registry.
- **Procurement/Legal:** Enforce contract standards and negotiate clauses.

## Documentation
All artifacts stored in centralized GRC system, linked to corresponding ingestion connectors and revision history.
