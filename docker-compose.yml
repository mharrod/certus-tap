# Certus Network Provider
# This file creates the shared network used across all Certus services
#
# Usage:
#   just up              # Recommended - orchestrates all services
#   docker compose up    # Alternative - ensures network exists
#
# Individual services are in:
# - certus_infrastructure/docker-compose.yml
# - certus_ask/deploy/docker-compose.yml
# - certus_trust/deploy/docker-compose.yml
# - certus_assurance/deploy/docker-compose.yml
# - certus_transform/deploy/docker-compose.yml
