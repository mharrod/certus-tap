# Governance

This document describes how Certus TAP is governed, how decisions are made, and how participation evolves over time.

Certus TAP is currently in an **early, pre-alpha phase**. Governance is intentionally lightweight and centralized to protect architectural integrity while foundational systems are being established.

---

## Project Status

**Phase:** Pre-Alpha / Experimental

During this phase:
- Architectural decisions are centralized
- External contributions are gated
- Stability, compatibility, and support are not guaranteed
- Governance may evolve rapidly

This governance model will be revisited as the project matures.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Maintainers

**Maintainers** are responsible for the overall direction, integrity, and stewardship of the project.

Responsibilities include:
- Defining architecture and technical direction
- Approving or rejecting proposals
- Granting or revoking access
- Reviewing and merging contributions
- Managing releases and milestones
- Enforcing project standards and conduct

**Maintainer selection**
- Maintainers are appointed by existing maintainers
- There is no automatic promotion path at this stage

---

### Contributors (Gated)

**Contributors** may be granted scoped access by invitation.

Contributors:
- Must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
- May have limited or full write access
- Operate under maintainer guidance
- Do not have decision authority by default

Contributor access:
- Is discretionary
- May be time-bound or scope-limited
- May be revoked at any time

---

### Reviewers (Optional / Emerging)

**Reviewers** may be invited to:
- Participate in design discussions
- Review proposals or pull requests
- Provide architectural or domain feedback

Reviewers:
- Do not have merge authority
- Do not make final decisions
- May or may not be contributors

---

## Decision-Making Model

### Early Stage (Current)

During pre-alpha:
- Maintainers make final decisions
- Feedback is welcomed but not binding
- Decisions prioritize:
  - Architectural coherence
  - Security and assurance properties
  - Long-term maintainability

There is **no voting or consensus requirement** at this stage.

---

### Proposals & Changes

Significant changes may require:
- A written proposal
- Architecture diagrams (where appropriate)
- Explicit maintainer approval

Maintainers may:
- Accept
- Request revisions
- Defer
- Reject proposals without obligation to implement

---

## Contribution Policy

- External contributions are not open by default
- All contributors must sign the CLA
- Signing the CLA does not guarantee acceptance of contributions
- The project may decline contributions that do not align with current goals

See:
- `ACCESS.md` (if present)
- `CLA.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

---

## Transparency & Communication

- The repository is public for transparency and knowledge sharing
- Some discussions, designs, or planning may occur privately
- Not all internal deliberations will be published

This is intentional during early development.

---

## Code of Conduct

All participants must follow the project's Code of Conduct.

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Enforcement
- Conflict resolution
- Ensuring a respectful and professional environment

See: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

---

## Governance Evolution

Certus TAP governance is expected to evolve as the project matures.

Planned milestones may include:
- Opening issues and pull requests
- Publishing formal contribution guidelines
- Introducing clearer role progression
- Establishing a technical steering group
- Exploring foundation or neutral governance models

Any governance changes will be documented in this file.

---

## Final Authority

Until governance evolves further:

> **Final decision-making authority rests with the maintainers.**

This is a deliberate choice to ensure the project can mature without fragmentation or instability.

---

## Questions

Questions about governance, access, or participation can be directed to the project maintainers.
