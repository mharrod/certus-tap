# Agentic Security Workflows

> **Status:** Coming Soon

> **Target Audience:** Developers, Security Engineers, Security Analysts, SOC Teams

## Overview

Agentic Security Workflows bring AI-powered automation to both **secure software development** (shift-left) and **security operations** (reactive response). Developers use agents to catch vulnerabilities during coding, while security teams use agents to investigate incidents and hunt threats in production.

## Potential Tutorials

### AI-Assisted Secure Code Review

- Agent reviews pull requests for vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 detection and remediation
- Educational feedback with policy links

### Threat Modeling Assistance

- Generate threat models from architecture diagrams
- Automated STRIDE analysis
- Attack tree generation for new features

### Dependency Security Management

- Monitor CVEs for project dependencies
- Suggest safe upgrade paths
- Auto-generate SBOMs and vulnerability reports

### Security Test Generation

- Create security test cases from threat models
- Generate fuzzing inputs for APIs
- Validate security controls are working

### CVE Incident Investigation Workflow

- Autonomous evidence gathering from Assurance MCP
- Provenance verification via Trust MCP
- OSV/NVD database correlation
- Automated incident summary generation

### Multi-Agent Parallel Investigations

- Evidence Collector + Validator + Analyst coordination
- Parallel evidence gathering workflows
- Agent handoff patterns

### Proactive Threat Hunting Agents

- Weekly hunt for suspicious artifacts
- Transparency log anomaly detection
- Unsigned/anomalous artifact identification
