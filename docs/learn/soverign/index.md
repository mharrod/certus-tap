# Sovereign AI with Certus TAP

> **Status:** Coming Soon
> **Target Audience:** Developers, Security Engineers, Compliance Officers, Government & Regulated Industry Teams

## Overview

**Sovereign AI** extends Certus TAP's Trust, Assurance, and Protect capabilities to environments requiring complete data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and autonomous operation. This includes air-gapped deployments, edge computing, and scenarios where data must remain within specific geographic or jurisdictional boundaries.

Built on the same TAP framework that secures cloud-native applications, Sovereign AI enables organizations to deploy trusted AI systems in disconnected or highly regulated environments while maintaining full control over data, models, and policies.

## Planned Tutorial Series

These tutorials will guide you through deploying sovereign AI systems with TAP:

### Sovereign Workspace Configuration

1. **Setting Up Isolated Workspaces** - Configure multi-tenant boundaries for regulatory compliance
2. **Data Residency Enforcement** - Implement geographic and jurisdictional constraints
3. **Offline Authentication & Access Control** - Local identity management without external dependencies
4. **Audit Trail Configuration** - Enable tamper-evident logging for compliance

### Model & Content Integrity

5. **Scanning AI Model Artifacts** - Detect vulnerabilities in models before deployment
6. **Knowledge Base Integrity Verification** - Ensure vector stores haven't been compromised
7. **RAG Pipeline Quality Monitoring** - Evaluate retrieval effectiveness with RAGAS
8. **Deriving Assurance Manifests** - Generate cryptographically signed manifests documenting models, data sources, scan results, and policy configurations for regulatory audit and deployment verification

### Privacy & Policy Enforcement

9. **Deploying Offline Lab in a Box** - Single-node sovereign deployment with systemd + podman
10. **Configuring Privacy-Preserving Guardrails** - Block sensitive data exposure at inference time
11. **Implementing Policy Enforcement** - Define and apply sovereign-specific rules
12. **Secure Content Synchronization** - Update disconnected environments while maintaining sovereignty

### Advanced Scenarios

13. **Multi-Node Sovereign Deployments** - Distribute TAP across controlled infrastructure
14. **Federated Learning Pipelines** - Train models across air-gapped environments
15. **Hybrid Cloud Integration** - Connect sovereign nodes to central systems securely
16. **Impact & Compliance Reporting** - Generate audit reports without exposing sensitive data

**Next Steps**: As tutorials become available, this page will be updated with hands-on guides.
