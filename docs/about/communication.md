## Communication Guidelines

### Before Posting

1. **Search first**: Check if your question has been answered
2. **Choose the right stream**: Use the appropriate channel for your topic
3. **Use topics**: Create descriptive topic names for your threads
4. **Be specific**: Include relevant details, error messages, and context

### When Reporting Issues

Include:

- Certus TAP version
- Environment (OS, Docker version, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce
- Error messages and logs
- Expected vs actual behavior

### When Asking Questions

- Describe what you're trying to accomplish
- Show what you've already tried
- Include relevant configuration or code snippets
- Mention which tutorial or documentation you're following
