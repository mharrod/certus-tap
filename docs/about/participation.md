# Participation & Contributions

Certus TAP is an open, research-driven exploration of trust, assurance, and secure AI systems. At this stage, the project is **early, experimental, and intentionally protected**. The repository is public to share ideas, architecture, and direction . We are not yet able to solicit open contributions at scale.

This is a deliberate choice to keep everyone sane while we lay the foundations. Nevertheless, if you really want to contribute early then please send and email to certustap@gmail.com

Please provide:

1. A brief introduction (background, experience)
2. What aspect of Certus TAP interests you
3. How you believe you could contribute in the future

Requests are reviewed manually. Access may include:

- Private design discussions
- Architecture reviews
- Proposal feedback
- Scoped contributor or reviewer roles
