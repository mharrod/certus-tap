# Legacy Agent Rules

The canonical rules now live in `/AGENTS.md` (loaded by Zed through `.rules`). This file remains only as a pointer for older workflows.

Before working:

1. Read `/AGENTS.md`.
2. Load `.context/CONTEXT.md` for project state.
3. Use `.context/bootstrap*.txt` or `.context/session-charter.md` for role-specific guidance.
